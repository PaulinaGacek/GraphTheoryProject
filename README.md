# GraphTheoryProject
This is the final project for Graph Theory Labolatories. The aim of the prohect was to implement Edmonds-Karp Algorithm, which is an implementation of the Fordâ€“Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network.

## How it works ##
The programme reads data from given file and calculates maximum flow from source vertex to sink vertex. However it works correctly only if given file meets undermentioned conditions:

### 1. Proper file localization ###
To enable programme to read data from file the .txt file should be located in cmake-build-debug folder, where other test files are located.

### 2. Correct syntax ###
